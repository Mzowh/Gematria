# Gematria
My Open-Source Gematria program

# How to use:
1. Create a file named GematriaInput.txt (The program will read from this, if you do not have it, you will get a message saying that you need to create it.)
2. Enter your phrases and 'directives'
3. Run the program
4. Open GeneratedSite.HTML

# Directives
1. "@Include" (File Path)

__Include another input file into the phrase list__

2. "@Comment" (Comment)

__Add a note to a phrase__

3. "@DocName" (Name of document)

__Lets you keep track and group your phrases__
